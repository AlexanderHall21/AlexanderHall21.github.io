                I would test and test until something came out, re-read instructions over and over until something clicked. Google and if that failed, 
                then ask the facilitator or fellow students.
                Emotional Intelligence has to do with emotions obviously and how intelligent you are with your own 
                emotions and others. It has to do with understanding people and by understanding people, you can 
                begin to understand behaviours and that’s how we build connections!

                There was nothing elegant about the way I solved problems, I just tried to do what the instructions said, half the issue was understanding 
                what the instructions even mean but hey, just my limited understanding here. I enjoy challenges but some parts were like "what the heck have I gotten
                myself into?"

            I feel the need to express myself about how I felt during, if you don’t like it ah well. It’s my blog so haha!

            Pseudocode, no idea why they have such complicated words, what’s wrong with notes? Something basic, yeh I get it. It’s pretty simple, add a “//” and whatever “notes” you want.

            The duck thing, yeah don’t think I am at a level to have conversations about code and figure out the issue. It’s only been 4 weeks of coding so far, 4 weeks.
            I would say I am still a beginner at best.

            My biggest challenge after spending hours and some codes was realising I still need more time to understand it. 
            I’ve accepted that I won’t get some of these challenges right now because they are just way too advanced for me! 
            It may click at some point but the line has to be drawn, yes I have expectations to pass everything but I may not understand right now how too.

            That has to be okay, can’t be beating myself and getting frustrated, which did happen a lot. Feeling like an idiot because the information just will not sink in, 
            reading line after line of code getting more and more upset just is not healthy and doesn’t help at all. 
        </p>

            Truth is, I really don’t understand much about javascript at all and that’s okay. It has to be, I mean it’s only been 2 weeks if that and I am somehow expected to just get it? 
            Anyway at the end of the day I am still breathing and alive and full of energy, and that’s the important part! Besides, I cant run before knowing how to walk, am I right?
