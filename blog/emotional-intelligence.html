            <div style="text-align:left"; style=>WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE?</div>
            <p>This is my personal interpretation of EQ, it may be a lot different to your idea of what it is so take it as you will. 
                Do you want the red pill or the blue pill?
                <p>Emotional Intelligence has to do with emotions obviously and how intelligent you are with your own 
                    emotions and others. It has to do with understanding people and by understanding people, you can 
                    begin to understand behaviours and that’s how we build connections!</p> 
                
                
                <div>EMOTIONS AS A STRUCTURE
                </div>
            
            <p>First we have “beliefs” that you have about yourself.</p>
                <p>Second we have thoughts which are generated from the belief.</p>
                <p>Third we have the feeling, the emotional experience you know love, fear…</p>
                <p>Finally we have the behaviour, and this is the grounding factor that creates the actions, ya know
            holding a beautiful woman and kissing her tenderly or stealing from the bank!</p>
                
            </p>
        <div>DEMO</div>
            
    <p> I’ll give you a demo situation of sorts, try to break it down in a physical way;
        So you like being happy huh? You like the feeling of ease and everything happening in a way that seems magical, am I right? Well…There’s actually nothing stopping you..
        Let’s refer back to our list above, our structure. What did we say about beliefs, that they’re the blueprint right? Well let’s see, if you have a belief that you’re not deserving of being happy you will always deprive yourself of your preference to be happy. Well that sucks, so there’s nothing you can do right? Nope, change the belief from not being deserving to being deserving and boom. Can’t be that simple right? Yes it is, has to be simple or it wouldn’t work. This is the part that surprises people, that it doesn’t have to be a grind or a struggle, of course you can make it that way if you want.

            <div>MEDITATION
            </div>
            
            
            <p>Fantastic tool used to realign, readjust and reconnect. The biggest issue I see with this is that people go into a 
                positive state when meditating but they lose it when they come out. Why is that you say, why can you not maintain it? 
                Well I am glad you asked, think of it like a circuit and here’s the key, you have to behave differently. Perform the 
                actions you saw in your meditation, and boom you will ground the energy and complete the circuit. This is a physical 
                reality, so you need to perform physical actions otherwise you're not grounding the energy properly, 
                which means you're only getting half the benefit. 
            </p>
            
            <div>EXAMPLE</div>
            <p>I’ll give you a basic analogy, let’s say you meditate on going out and drinking with friends and your intentions 
                are to get drunk. You can meditate till you’re black and blue but unless you drink that drink you will not get drunk!

                Another basic one, watch happy people and how they behave. What’s the most obvious behaviour they have? 
                That’s right, a smile, that’s an action. 
                
                </p>
            
            <div>FEAR</div>
            
            <p>Ooooh no, too scary, spooky.. You can actually use this emotion to realise how powerful you are. Next 
                time you feel terrified, simply recognize it instead as power and begin to realize how 
                much power it takes to make you generate a feeling of fear. It’s a lot, a hell of a lot.</p>

                <div>HOW IS IT DIFFERENT TO IQ?</div>
                <p>Well I try not to separate the two, because they are essentially both a form of intelligence. But it says I need to 
                    compare the two for 
                    this example, so I’ll give it a go. IQ is generally related to understanding how things work, things like 
                    trucks and cars and how to fix them. How to I don’t know, build a website? Or a rocket, it’s important to 
                    understand how things work. How to tie shoes, cook food, it’s relative to survival. Emotional IQ just deals
                     with people’s emotions, behaviours and connectivity to others. That’s quite simply how it works, nothing complicated at all.</p>
                     <div>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</div>
                     <p>Well unfortunately we don’t live on this planet alone, we have to learn to share. We have to learn to get
                          along so we can build the planet of our dreams, where we don’t have to suffer anymore. It’s truly important to 
                          learn to connect to others because it really brings us a much more positive experience and makes us realize that
                           we are all similar in that we all have a wish to help others if we can. If you’re building a company, you are
                            going to need to connect to potential employers in order to make income. Quite simply, you have to learn to 
                            connect, and emotional intelligence is a huge part of it. People build trust from knowing more about you and 
                            who you are, there’s no way around it. If you aren’t good at connecting to people, you are going to find it 
                            more difficult in this world! That’s the bottom line.
