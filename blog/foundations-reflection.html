    <h3 style="text-align: center">Things About Ego</h3>
        
    <div id="textbody">
        <p>
         3 things I have learnt about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning is that
         when I think and hear my mind say "I cannot", I am usually close to breaking through to 
         the "I can." Learning is something continuous, and it is always changing. I think a lot
         of how my mind is structured needs to change, so during my break I will remedy this.
         Really be more easy on myself, and really relax even more than usual and allow myself to
         simply flow efforlessly through life.     
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Self Awareness In Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Self awareness is absolutely crucial to this course and all avenues of life, becoming
            more aware is fundamental to any kind of significant changes in any direction. The word
            consciouness literally translates to self awareness. You cannot change things that
            you are not aware of, this is just logic. I find I operate when I am relaxed and at
            full ease, even though I may not know the answers often rather than struggling through a
            situation, sometimes the most obvious solution is to ask for help. Which was quite funny
            to me, but did make a lot of sense.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Suprises About Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Week 4 was suprising to me because I got so down on myself, which I didn't think 
            could happen. I am however greatful it did, cause I was able to adjust quite quickly
            and proceed with the challenges. I think my ability to not care about what happens
            because I am for the majority of my time happy where I am has been useful. I think
            I'll reduce my complaining to zero, as this state doesn't help me at all. Other than
            these things I was suprisingly suprised at what I was able to achieve, well not really.
            I adapt very quickly, sometimes within mere minutes, which has been massive.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Challenges</h3>
        <p> Week 4 was perhaps my biggest challenge. Another one is stop believing people when
            they say it's hard. I automatically find things hard when I define them as hard, which
            shouldn't be a suprise because what you put out, is what you get back. Need to redefine
            hard to challenging and add the energy of excitement, this will allow me to breeze through
            or at the very least not have as many for lack of a better term "blocks". 
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Focus On Core Learning</h3>
        <p>
            I think we spend so much on the core learning because it's important to be able to 
            connect in a positive way, positivity is naturally intergrative so you can easily build
            far more effectively. I like to think that this enables us to get better jobs, but aside
            from that I think it's quite simply to build better human beings. This is the aspect I 
            love most about this academy, the human aspect. Spirituality is my passion, and I am ready
            to contribute to a better world without suffering, if that's what people want.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Important Or Waste</h3>
        <p>
            I don't think anything I done was a waste of time especially the core ideas. I think
            its great because I have been told to share the information I have with others, just
            and I think is important I share with others and it's no buisness of mine what they do
            with it. I used to see infividuals as weak, shy or fragile. Knowing what I know now I
            refuse to see them as anything but powerful individuals, even if they see themselves
            as something less. No more need for victims. So I am all for embracing the human side
            because despite our supposed flaws, we are all innately wanting to feel connected. I
            would justify my answer, but I never feel I need to justify myself, nor do I ever feel
            a need to prove myself. That is true empowerment.

        <h1 id="reflectionstitle"style="text-align: left;">My Reflections</h1>
        <h3 id=sprinttitle style="text-align: left">Sprint 1</h3>
        
        <p  id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? 
            Can you think of an analogy for it?</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            A text based way to navigate, create and delete files. Very simplistic basic tools to achieve 
            anything to do with programming. Command Line, would be like commanding a line? :D
        </p>   

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would 
            you make next time?</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            Nope, never been one to stick to a time structure. I like to finish any work that I start, 
            or at least to a point where im satisfied. It's just what seems to work best for me, more my rythmn.
        </p>   

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            "cd" is quite common, just means change directory. It's a way to navigate through files without 
            using the gui. Uh, "echo" just creates an echo :D ".." is a pretty cool one when you want to go 
            backwards, I see myself using this a lot. "exit" pretty self explanatory, when you're too lazy to hit 
            the X icon :D "dir" is for directory, just shows you whats in that particular directory.
        </p>   

        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Install and Explore Git</p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Whats the difference between git and GitHub?</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Other than the difference in spelling and being two completely different words? In all seriousness though, 
            one is a cloud based server and the other allows you to manage your code history. 
            Git you mostly use the command line (gitbash), and GitHub you're generally using the gui. 
            Not too sure which ones more user friendly, they both seem confusing right now :D
        </p>


        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            As far as analogies I don't know if it's a good one, Github would be a box of crayons, lot's of different colours. 
            Whereas Git would be the pencil, old school way, very basic. Both are capable options, both can achieve similair objectives.
            Different tools I guess, is what would sum it up.
        </p>    

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            I noticed with my learning that practical activities were far easier than reading line after line of theory :D 
            I've always been a hands on person, we call it a "tutu" in my native Maori language, and it generally means that
            I just play with it and see what it does. As far as confusion? Definitely a lot of confusion at first, had to 
            really take my time and read instructions properly, rewind a video or what not to really achieve that clarity. 
            Did ask my facilitator for assistance at one point, was in creating a file. However was annoyed when she mentioned 
            it was probably just to create any file name with a .md or a .html at the end. I thought I needed another program to 
            create one :D 
        </p>   

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning 
            exploration again?</p> 
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            No point, can't go back in time! No, but part of learning is that you're always learning. Of 
            course you can try to think back and think if I had've or should've then this would've, 
            however the point is did you learn, and is that good enough? 
            For me I definitely think it is for me.
        </p>    

        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Branch, Pull, Merge</p>

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What is main?</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Main or master branch is just the first branch.
        </p>    

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Why create a Branch?</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            It's easier to create a seperate branch in order to not affect the main branch. If someone is working on 
            the main branch and you create your own branch, you don't affect one another.
        </p>    

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</p> 
        
        <p style="text-align: left;"> 
            No point telling them, they wouldn't understand! In all seriousness though, staging is selecting 
            files you want to 
            send or commit. Commit just means files are ready to send, waiting to be pushed or uploaded.
        </p>    
        
        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># GitHub Fork & Clone</p>

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What are some examples of when you would fork?</p> 
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            When you need to clone something in order to make changes to it.
            Or if you wanted to have a copy of your own.
        </p>    

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</p> 
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            A couple times, first was when I was using 
            git command instead of git bash wondering why my commands weren't working. Got there in the end! Another was 
            I couldn't push to GitHub but I realised I hadn't commited the file and so there was nothing to push.. 
            Was kind of annoyed with that one! Ah well, fun n games.
        </p>    

        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Setup Repo & Create Blog</p>

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Was a pretty simple excercise, am quite suprised it's that easy to make a webpage. As far as frustration,
            kept forgetting to add "git" before the command push! Other than that, fairly simple.
        </p>    

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured?</p> 
            
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?</p> 
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            I've seen examples, I didn't realise
            it was that easy though. Always thought it was a lot more complicated and took a genius. 
            I've seen it done in a gui kind of tool before, but not with coding. So am really suprised, 
            just wondering how many lines of code you might need and wondering if it's as daunting as it looks..
        </p>    

        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Thinking like a programmer</p>

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What is your process so far for solving problems?</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            First of all don't think of it as a 
            "problem" that for me just makes it seem so much more difficult than it needs to be. 
            I prefer "challenge" and I just try to figure out how to complete it. If I can't then google, 
            if still nothing ask someone for help. Generally though I am quite able to figure most things out, 
            there isn't like a time frame, kind of just depends on how long it takes to understand it. 
            I find that getting excited allows me to solve it faster, any kind of positive state really 
            decreases the lag between not understanding and clarity. When it's fun, it's easy kind of mindset!
        </p>    

        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Introduce yourself</p>

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</p> 
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Fairly easy if I am being honest, 
            I am a very confident person and am not really rattled by other peoples opinions. 
            It's all just fun and games for me, so I just give it my all. Lifes a mystery, so in my experience 
            I've just learned to stay positive no matter what and life really opens up to you!
        </p>    

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Could you feel your ego?</p> 
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            Were you self conscious? Nah not at all, I feel quite comfortable in my own skin. 
            There was a little doubt before I pushed enter to send, but that's minor if it's even anything! 
            I love to laugh and I do it often, something about it is so freeing. Great experience, 
            it shows me the levels I've grown which is astounding as I remember at University giving a 
            speach in front of a small group was so daunting. Now I could stand easily in front of thousands! 
            Well that's what I'd like to believe :)
        </p>
        <h3 id=sprinttitle style="text-align: left">Sprint 2</h3>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Creating a web page blog and uploading it online. Seems simple but uh it's a little 
            tricky but I always like a challenge.</p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">## How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Don't use timeboxes, usually just work till im satisfied with the goal I was aiming for.
        </p>
        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Learn HTML and CSS</p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What obstacles did you come up against? 
            How did you overcome them?</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Just worked my magic and used google, advice from facilitator as well 
            which is helpful. Mostly though, just followed the instructions.
        </p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What are of you proud of from this challenge?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Honestly just finishing, it seemed difficult in the beginning but I kept going and managed to get the result.
        </p>               
        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. 
            You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture 
            insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            HTML is the very simple code the p, h1 etc. Now with CSS, 
            it's more flamboyant and has more style literally. HTML would be like living your life and 
            CSS would be all the joy and laughter that happened in life. Both are as important as 
            each other, and both are needed. One is not more important than the other.    
        </p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Any moments of surprise or joy?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Many a moment, when I inserted code correctly hit f5 in the html file and boom. Honestly 
            like magic!
        </p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they 
            would be? Why?</p>
         
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Html would be a cat and Css would be a dog! Cat's are boring and independent, they're not concerned about 
            much except food. Css would be a dog because dogs are so expressive in everything they do!    
        </p>

        <h3 id=sprinttitle style="text-align: left">Sprint 3</h3>
        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Mindfulness</p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Do you have any biases for or against 
            mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: left;">Nope, being mindful is just being more aware of what's going on 
            both around and within you. It's just consciousness which simply means being more 
            aware, how can being more aware be a negative thing?
        </p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### How did you find the overall experience?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            I practice this all the time, so my experience is simply normal to me. I am very aware of my abilities
             and I often live quite a joyful life compared to most. Different levels I guess, I've 
             commited myself fully to these ideas for the last few years and it enables you to really 
             live a life of ease and really helps release fears.
        </p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What's your daily habit commitment?</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Personally it seems to be a focus of meditation which is fine fundamentally, 
            however meditation is a state of realigning and refocusing. You still need the action, 
            putting your new found awareness into everything you do, every movement and every breath.

        <p id="headmain"style="text-align: left;"># Listening and Looping</p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What was it like to be fully listened to?</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Ah pretty normal, I mean I have conversations with people everyday.. Was nothing new, I can understand 
            people who may be isolated..Isn't this something that people always do anyway? I'm from Gizzy, 
            we have a small community, we say hi to everyone and call our mates mum mum. Mates are the bro or 
            the cuzzy, I mean everyone communicates down here so it's nothing different. 
        </p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What was it like to fully listen?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            It's nothing new really, if you're generally interested it's pretty easy to listen. 
            If it's boring then I guess it would feel like torture, but yeah it's natural for me 
            to be able to have conversations with people and listen. May not remember always what you 
            are talking about though!

            What resources worked for you and why?</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: left;">My learning style seems to change often, it's almost like 
            theres different people at different times. What's most important for me
            is to enjoy it, it's so much easier when you enjoy it. Probably why I didn't 
            like school, it was boring and teachers lacked imagination. Either that or I was too focused 
            on women! :D

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? 
            If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling 
            like you had to _master_ the basics?</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            I don't use timebox, just how I am. I don't even plan really, I just understand 
            there will be a time when I need to do something and that's the only moment I need to think about that. 
            Until that moment, theres no point thinking about it. Otherwise I just do what I feel like doing,
            currently I've worked since 12pm and it's 7pm and it's felt like 10mins. This is just how I operate, 
            go with the flow. Don't need to think about something until that moment if that makes sense.

            style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            My learning style is just go with the flow. It's strengths are I don't worry at all, 
            and if I do find I can't figure something out I'll ask.. I asked a couple people for help, 
            I find that trying to learn by reading is not as powerful as learning through someone explaining 
            something. It's like I can understand them when I hear them verbally, like theres 
            energy that just gets passed to me. It's weird, but it works so meh who cares :D

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Wouldn't say blocks, but I did realise that it may take a lot of 
            time to figure something out than if I just asked for a simpler explanation. I honestly 
            don't know why people think complicated is intelligent, adding elements that aren't needed. 
            Basic is smart, even Einstein said "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand 
            it well enough."

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            4 at the moment, but usually it's upwards of 8 dev related tabs, so what's that more than 
            90% of my tabs. I close all of them though before sleep because I like to relax and leave 
            work for later. Helps me not dream of code :D

            Hmm I didn't get too into it personally, it's interesting but I was probably focused on

            going forward. What's the analogy, copy and paste?

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The easier it is to understand, I like simplicity. Probably the wrong industry to be in 
            regards to coding.

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?</p>

        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? 
            Is your code a reflection of that?</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Relatively clean and simple, should see my car it's always immaculate inside.
            I just like clean environments, gives you a sense of ease. My code, well at the moment I couldn't 
            care less, just trying to get the commands to work.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            I thought it was fun to begin with, but then... Then it got beyond confusing and I 
            don't even understand any of it. It's trying to understand the code, which I can't.
        </p>
        <p id="headone"style="text-align: left;">### Was it helpful to look at the tests while 
            coding the kata?</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">    
            Seeing it go red over and over is annoying because it can't tell you what the exact issue is,
            just that theres something wrong with the code. I honestly don't think even after completing
            the katas that I even understand them. I don't find i fun trying to problem solve when I don't 
            even know what the problem is. I've given up hundreds of times already, praying a solution will come. 
            Looking at the samples makes it worse because the answers there but I don't understand any of it,
            or how anyone was even able to solve it. I'm usually quite positive, but this part of the 
            sprint was utterly difficult. I don't know how they expect me to solve half these things in the 
            alloted time, think I have a better chance at being a millionaire. Thing is its only been 2 
            weeks and they expect me to solve this?

            No problem solving techniques work other than trial and error, and asking for help. That or giving up.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The instructions.. Like, honestly.. value, array, element, object! I think we need a way 
            to simplify things for those of us who don't understand. I know what they are now but honestly, 
            shit was mentally draining watching code fail over and over. If you gave it to me again I can 
            honestly tell you, I am not certain I could pass it again. I don't get it, the challenges are way too 
            difficult for my skill level. The first 2 were fun, that's about my level. The rest, just felt
            like a cruel joke. Spending hours going around in circles.

            No, after I finished I wanted to eat, sleep or go for a long drive. Burn my laptop and never go
             back to coding :D A bit dramatic I know but holy cow. I'll bounce back soon enough, 
             I'll get it.
