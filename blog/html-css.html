<h1>IDs and Classes</h1>

<h2>What is an ID?</h2>
An ID is a specific tag used to identify a singular element. Honestly trying to explain it is tough, I'll just show you how!


<p>Here we have an example of an id tag</p> 
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xgDVjVq/id-main-text.png" alt="id-main-text" border="0"></p>


<p>Say we wanted to add a color or a font, with an id tag we can add different attributes to our text line. In this example we'll use 
  the text "An ID is a specfic tag used to identify a singular element," and we'll go ahead and change it to blue.</p>

 
<p>First we insert some id tags like so. </p>
  <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XLJ6qdR/Main-Text-ID-double.png" alt="Main-Text-ID-double" border="0"></p>



<p>Then we insert a hash tag in styling to add the attribute of blue like so.</p>

</p>


<p>Making sure we keep it in between our "style" tags. This is important because style tags allow us to add different attributes such as color, sizing, font etc.</p>


<p>We should then get our highlighted line </p>

Let's see if we can get it to magically turn blue!</p>

<p>And just like that, we have magically created blue text!</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Now with classes it's similair to an id tag but instead of one tag, you can apply multiple at once. So to break it down think
  of it like this, an id is for one and classes are for, you guessed it multiple! </p>
 
<p>If you think that's easy, it's even easier if I just show you!</p>

<p>First we create some div tags, I'll say around 3, in our tags well create a class called "dot".</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hY39QbF/3-divs.png" alt="3-divs" border="0"></p>
<p>Then we go up to our style tags and add some attributes for each of our "dot" classes. Let's make 3 round orange dots. Yummy oranges!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5YJKRjj/Styling-Dot.png" alt="Styling-Dot" border="0"></p>
<p>What we're hoping for, is that our code will register and create 3 orange dots.</p>

<p> Will it work? Pray for a miracle!</p>

<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>Really ready?</p>
<div class="dot"></div>
<div class="dot"></div>
<div class="dot"></div>
<p>Bam it worked, we now have 3 orange dots. Congratulations! It's simple when you know how. Well that's the difference between id's and classes.
  Hopefully you can grasp some part of it and that it isn't too difficult to understand!
