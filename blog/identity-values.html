    </br><h3 style="text-align:center">CORE VALUES</h3>
            <div style="text-align:center"; style="font-family:tahoma">LOVE</div>
            <p>Not just for others but just as importantly for yourself.
            This is of the utmost importance to me, we’re all connected and there’s no denying it.</p> <p>Everyone deserves love, 
            we are all capable of it and we don’t quite use it enough.</p>
            
            <p>EMPOWERMENT</p>
        <p>Empowering not just yourself but others as well, it’s more fun when there’s more involved. 
        <p>Lifting up others is a reward unto itself.</p>
            
    <p> When you’re empowered you’re like a light unto others in revealing to them that they can also choose to be empowered. 
Never dim your light, shine so you give them the chance to perhaps decide to shine too.</p>
            
            <p>FUN</p>
            <p>When you’re having fun time goes by in seconds, you’re able to explore more and even do more both physically and energetically!
            
            <p>I feel as though many people have this idea that we always need to be serious, it’s not necessary. Look at the 
                children who play with anyone and enjoy themselves with the most mundane of circumstances. I’ve seen children
                 with a stick enjoy themselves more than a millionaire in a fancy car!</p>
            
            <p>RESPECT</p>
            <p>When you truly respect yourself, you naturally respect others and their choices regardless of what they choose.</p>
            
            <p>I’ve seen many people demand respect as if it’s something that needs to be given. The truth is that it’s a choice, 
            you can choose to feel respected or disrespected. Always important to recognize the choice you’re making!</p>
            
            <p>FREEDOM</p>
            <p>The ability to choose is fundamental to all life, the freedom to express yourself as you wish is always your 
                right as an inpidual.
            
            <p>Freedom is always given and can never be taken away, I see too many people give it away to others who have no 
            idea what to do with it, and rightly so, as it’s not their freedom to begin with!</p>
            
            <p>POSITIVITY</p>
            <p>This one is fundamental to me and has changed my life for the better, no circumstance regardless of how it 
                seems can’t not have a positive meaning.</p>
            
            <p>Even if the meaning is to not experience it again! Look for the positives in all situations, don’t just define 
                it as negative!</p>
            
            <p>HUMOUR</p>
            <p>The ability to laugh is a fantastic way to lighten up on life and having someone to share it with makes it 
                even more delightful. It’s a simple way to break the ice and allows connections to people from all walks in life.</p>
            
           <p>For a long time I was ridiculed for not being serious enough, the truth is I never enjoyed it. It was always exhausting, 
               I should've never listened to my High School English teacher. There’s comedians making millions just to make people laugh, 
               never underestimate the power of laughter.</p>
              
            
            
            
            <h3>STRENGTHS</h3>
            
            <p>POSITIVITY</p>
            <p>Crucial to all avenues of life, a positive attitude can propel you forward in any situation! Relationships, 
                situations, you can apply this anywhere and it just makes life easier, isn’t that what we all want?</p>
            
            <p>CONFIDENCE</p>
            <p>This one they say is the “coup de grace” of life and enables you access to all avenues of life, they even say 
                some people have it and some people don’t.</p>
            <p>Got a little secret for you.. It’s impossible to not be confident, it’s only possible to be confident 
                that you’re not confident! How ya like them apples?!</p> 
            
            <p>HONESTY</p>
            <p>The truth makes it easier to see your character and it makes it much easier for people to trust you, believe and support you. 
                Also allows you to support yourself and your abilities more easily.</p>
            <p>What’s more important is being honest with yourself and admitting that sometimes you have to take a step
                 back and evaluate whether something is for you. You can never deceive yourself, you always know!</p>
            
            <p>SEXY</p>
            <p>Good for your mental health and good for your body, allows you to express yourself in a very powerful way, 
                such as rhythm, swagger or flirtation. Also allows you comfort with the opposite sex.</p>
            <p>Betcha didn’t see this one, ain’t nothing like having swagger and rhythm ooh boy! Ain’t nothing 
                wrong with being a sexy beast! Guarantee everyone of you hopes you’re sexy and you probably are!</p>
            
            
            <h3>LIMITATIONS</h3>
            
            <p>INDECISIVE</p>
            <p>Unable to make or commit to an idea, causes stagnation!</p>
        <p>Very rarely happens, but it does sometimes, I prefer to think of it more as a realignment phase for whatever is next.</p>
            
            <p>FEAR</p>
            <p>The most paralyzing emotion there is, stops everything flowing smoothly and effortlessly.
            Dealing with this less and less nowadays, using fear as an indicator to find beliefs out of alignment with who I prefer to be.</p>
            <p>It’s all about perspective, this emotion can actually lead to some of the most life changing experiences if you let it serve
             you in a positive way!</p>
            
            
            <h3>TENSION</h3>
            <p>A MC DONALDS WORKER STORY</p>
            
            <p>Once upon a time and I you guessed it, used to work at Mc Donalds Gisborne. Anyway one of my managers had a great 
            understanding of where everyone works best, and during the lunch period that’s essential. We have fun, we laugh and 
            joke and we are desperately understaffed, but because we’re having fun the work is getting done. Little side note, 
            I think employers underestimate how having a positive mindset is truly powerful!</p> <p>You’re willing to do more and you 
            become more energetic! Everything is flowing, going at a good pace until another manager comes in screaming that 
            we’re not supposed to be mucking around telling jokes and that it’s inappropriate and customers “might” hear us. 
            Congratulations, she knocked us out of our rhythm and now everyone is serious and now it’s a grind and a dash to 
            finish and go home.</p> <p>I kind of realised what had happened so once she had gone I made a few jokes at some of the boys 
            and got a lot of laughter back. She hadn’t broken us, and we got back into rhythm making it the playful atmosphere it 
            was before. The manager later came back and apologised to us saying she’d had a bad day and that she shouldn’t have taken 
            it out on us, she said it was because we were understaffed. I just laughed and said, “We’re always understaffed, it’s 
            Mcdonalds!”</p> <p>Looking back, the day probably would have continued to be stressful if I didn’t take up that role of breaking
             the ice, and sometimes that’s all it takes! I’ve talked to managers who work there currently and they take this to heart, 
             they have fun and enjoy themselves but they get the work done too and usually at a higher performance! Work together, 
             play together, teamwork makes the dream work!</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h3>ETHICAL DECISION</h3>
                <p>DOOM & GLOOM STORY</p>
            
            <p>Recently I was injured in my right index finger by a guy who attempted to stab both me and my friend. 
            Admittedly alcohol was involved at the time, but not heavily. I am not a violent person and do not 
            like to inflict injury on anyone regardless of background. </p><p>If I can avoid violence, then I most definitely will. 
            I’ve even been called “Buddah” for my refusal to enact any kind of harm on a person, I quite simply DO NOT enjoy 
            hurting people. However, once I realised this particular guy had escalated the situation by grabbing a knife, 
            I knew I had to prevent him from inflicting injuries on anyone. So I took him down and secured the knife to prevent 
            him swinging it around and wounding someone. Unfortunately my index finger grabbed the blade causing a small cut in
             my finger tendon.</p> <p>It did require surgery and rehab, but it was well worth it knowing no one was fatally wounded. 
             Was a tough lesson knowing that some people cannot be bargained or reasoned with, which is a shame as I always wish
              for a positive outcome for both parties. I guess I did the best and what I thought was the right course of action.
               He was arrested and is due for court in December.</p> <p>I've forgiven the guy and wish him luck, but I do believe he will 
               face some kind of penalty for this. Will have to see what happens in December.</p>
