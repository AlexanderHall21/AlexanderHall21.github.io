            <p>
                So you want an analogy for HTML and CSS? You came to the wrong place, I don’t know diddly squat! What I do know is 
                pretty basic terms, let’s see..</p> 
                <p>HTML would be your good old graphite friend, the pencil, simplistic and simple. 
                Your structure, your core. Everything you need for a good template of artistry. Important but lacks character..
                </p>
            
            <p>CSS on the other hand, this is where your creativity and vibrancy comes alive. You would compare it to crayons, 
                colouring pencils or paint where you can add any colour from blues to reds, yellows, oranges or whatever your 
                imagination could come up with! CSS is all the things on a webpage that makes it truly come alive. The fonts, 
                the sizing, the stuff that makes it appealing to the eye! CSS is the personality aspect of the two.
            </p>
        <p>CONTROL AND FLOW LOOPS</p>
            
    <p> Control Flow something I know even less about than the above, but hey I’ll give it a crack. So loop controls have conditions, 
        let’s say you want to go shopping for food. First you need money, if no money loop fails or you can't shop. If money is available 
        then you can shop. If you didn’t have money you could always add a condition to steal but that might end with “condition” jail, 
        which wouldn’t be fun. Think you get the idea..
    </p>
            
            <p>THE DOM
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Document Object Model, seriously I don’t know who comes up with these uninspiring boring titles but we’ll just stick 
                with it. DOM isn’t so bad, bland though, could’ve been worse.. POM for example, it never surprises me how developers
                 always come up with the most basic of terminologies. Anyhow we are straying off topic, the DOM is just a developer’s
                  tool you can use to access and see any code on a webpage. See what kind of headings they’ve chucked up or what colours
                   or font’s they’re using. Buttons functions, and where HTML links are displayed. It’s like the behind the scenes tour 
                   of a Lady Gaga. No wait, who is someone cooler? A Michael Jackson show, all the workers, the truss holding the lights
                    up, the screen LED’s, the instruments, curtains and all the props that go into the show. You can access the DOM by 
                    opening your browser and finding the developers tool, most browsers have it. It’s a great way to see pages in a 
                    javascript, html or css format, that is if you can read it!
            </p>
            
            <p>ARRAYS AND OBJECTS</p>
            <p>Arrays are just an array of items, let’s use the example of a tool box. Generally you want to keep the same kind of items 
                that are similar, so in a tool box you would have tools like a spanner, hammer, nails or a screwdriver. Think along the 
                terms of the same type of item, or closely related,  sort of a related list to store similar elements.
                Object on the other hand would be similar to a backpack, you can have a laptop, books, drink bottle, gym gear, pencil
                 case or food. Think random assortment of items, or classes of different items that all have the ability to be stored here,
                  really just allows us to store our classes more easily.
                </p>
            
            <p>FUNCTION</p>
            
            <p>Function is pretty simple enough, it’s literally just that, a function. Whether you are at home and your tv has a function
                 of off and on, same with a light switch. That’s generally what it means, but in javascript it’s a kind of a command. 
                 It allows you to launch certain inputs and create different parameters, which without the function will not work. It’s
                  useful because you can use it to launch coded messages, create names or even use a calculator. Basically I would refer 
                  to the function as the on switch as far as a line of code. So yeah pretty basic, hopefully I didn’t confuse you too much!</p>
