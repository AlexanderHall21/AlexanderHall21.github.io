    <h3 style="text-align:center">Long Term Goal</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center">In all honesty, I like to keep my goals objectviely simple. Right now, it's finish this course. Of course, there are always other variables that happen as well for example human connection, which is
        always fun! I think goals are different to dreams if that makes any sense objectively.</p>
        <p>Yeah for now focus on finishing this, and if new ideas come up I can add them, thing is I'm always changing. I am never really static, so just go with the flow really. You'll
            probably hear that a lot from me.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning Strengths And Limitations</h3>
        <p>One of my main strengths is that I am pretty resilient and am unphased most times, which definitely helps when you're trying to learn something.
        </p>
        <p>Another one of my strengths is that I always have a positive outloook, which when times seem tough and it seems like I have a block, I can realign and refocus. Really helpful this, reduces stress and allows you to just try to learn.</p>
        <p>Another key one is I am not afraid to fail, because failure to me is just learning. So I actually enjoy making mistakes, won't mention my personal relationships though! In all serious though, failing is just another mode of learning.</p>
        <p>Finally I have comunication, for example, I am not afraid to ask for help. If I feel I can't quite figure something out, I'll ask someone for their perspective. Which is what I've found a lot of people won't do!</p>
        
        <h3>Workload Commitment And Management</h3>
        
        <p>Well obviously would like to complete the alloted asignments within the right timeframe. How I go about that doesn't really matter, as long as it's done. 
            I think it's important not to put pressure on myself and really do it my way. I know when it needs to be done, and what needs doing. So trust myself really, chill out and go my own pace.</p>
         <p>Ideally I'd probably like to have the sprints done before Friday, ideally Thursday because I do have an active social life and am quite social. Other than that, no distractions that I can't manage. 
             If there are things that come up obviously I'll sort them out. I'm not concerned about anything in that aspect at all, pretty solid. Go with the flow really.
         </p>   
        <h3>Facillitator Expectations</h3>
         <p>I expect all the tricks of the trade and for them to do my work for me! Kidding, not really any expectations at all. They seem supportive and are always already helpful, it's actually really
             assuring knowing they are there and willing to help. That's more than I can ask for really, definitely not complaining.
         </p>
         <p>I think the main message is just to keep going and pushing on, I got this!</p>
