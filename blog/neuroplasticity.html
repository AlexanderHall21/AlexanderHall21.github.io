        <p>
            Well it’s just about building connections within yourself, in this case the brain which creates a sense of self and identity of sorts. 
            Whatever you focus on most is what grows, it’s not rocket science and it’s not that complicated either. 
            Focus on this equals growth in that area, change your focus and bam that equals growth in another area. 
            It benefits people because, well you’re never stuck. You can always change, but some choose to stay stuck and well, good for them.

        <div>Self Benefits of Neuroplasticity</div>
            
        <p>
            Well the benefits are that you can alter pretty much anything really, once you realise what's possible.
            I alter my brain all the time, but it’s not because of “situations” it’s because of my beliefs-feelings-emotions. 
            You can literally become a different person at any moment, and quite often people do without realising it. 
            Nothing to do with the situation, there’s a quote, a very wise one. “Circumstances don’t matter, only my state of being matters”. 
            “Neuroplasticity” is simply a side effect of you deciding to change, whether you are conscious about it or unconscious. 
            All you’re seeing is your ability to alter anything you want, cause guess what? You are that powerful, how powerful? 
            You can actually make yourself sick, try stressing for a few days and see if you can remain healthy.

        <div>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</div>
            
        <p> 
            Just realising you can alter it should be a clear indicator that you can really change it, which should be exciting because now you have no
            excuse to be the boring depressed person you may think you are, you can change it if you like.
            it’s just physics. Focus equals growth, in any direction. Neuroplasticity just means your brain is plastic, and you can mold it anyway you want.
            You can’t you say? Well, guess you’ll just grow some more connections that help you make sure you can’t.

            This link I found quite useful in demonstrating the strange way people love to over analyze things, in the sense is they focus far too much on the “brain”, 
            while yes it is important, very important. It is essentially just a piece of the pie, what is more important is understanding the power you have over your brain. 
            You can be influenced by your environment, others but only by choice whether that choice is conscious or unconscious. 
            Your ability to alter anything in your brain should suggest that well you aren’t just a brain? 
            There is something far more deeper here than people realise, an intrinsic understanding that we all have. 
            A much deeper understanding that we all innately have, that we are far more than just mere human beings. 
            There is a part of us that knows we are so much more and we strive to find out just what that is our entire lives, some of us find it. 
            Question is, can you?

        <div>Why is this relevant?</div>
            
            
        <p>
            I mean all you have to do is make a decision to grow in that area, there isn’t anything that can stop you from growing in whatever direction you choose.. 
            No one but you, isn't that empowering? It always comes back to you doesn’t it, did you know no one can stop you from believing in whatever you want? 
            No one has that power to change any idea you have, no one but you of course.
        </p>

        <div>Anything suprise you?</div>
        
        <p>
            It’s quite surprising to me that people really do not want to change, that’s the biggest surprise if there is one. 
            People like safety more than becoming a healthier, happier and overall better person. Most don’t believe they can change, 
            so.. I don’t know, take it as you will. Change is constant, that's just one thing that won't change.

        </p>

        <div>How will you integrate growth mindset?</div>
        
        <p> I don’t really need reinforcement or encouragement myself, cause I know how capable I am. For me it’s just really not worrying about coding or anything for that matter. 
            I find that when my mind starts building crazy scenarios and more difficulty than it should be, it usually means I'm taking it way too seriously. 
            Means stop, have a laugh and realise I am being an idiot. Whether or not I pass doesn’t matter, as long as I give it a go. May not succeed at everything in life, 
            but you can always have fun doing it and just maybe you're being led to another doorway which would be more in alignment with you, who knows? 

        </p>
        
        <p>
            Overall this to me is all very basic stuff, applying it to learning, well I have been. Strategy would be.. Go with the flow, my way probably wouldn’t work for others, 
            but it does for me. If there was only one path in life, there would only be one person. That’s why it’s important to find your own style and rhythm and not worry about others 
            opinions or their expectations because their expectations aren’t yours, they’re theirs. Don’t steal other people’s expectations, that’s just stealing. Same with their beliefs, 
            make your own up, doesn’t matter how ridiculous they are. It’s your life, believe and dream whatever you want.
        </p>

        <p>
            All I have to succeed in this course is really just have fun doing what I am doing, and I truly believe I can. I just need to redefine my defintions of why I think coding
            is "boring" and change it to "hey this is fun." It really is that simple, and that's basic neuroplasticity in a nutshell!
